<p>This work is intended to be used as a guide for
officers and N.C.O.&#8217;s in training bombers. The lectures
given at intervals as the men advance in the training
will emphasize the features to be observed. A syllabus
for a bombers&#8217; school covering a period of six days is
shown on page <a href="#Page_37">37</a> as a further guide to instructors. A
list of material and equipment necessary to carry out
the syllabus is shown on page <a href="#Page_38">38</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to the adoption by the British War Office of
the present method of fighting on the Western front,
namely, the use of bombs and grenades (which for practical
purposes require the same care as high explosives),
it was not necessary for the rank and file of the
Infantry to have any great knowledge of explosives, any
work that entailed the extensive use of explosives being
left to the Engineers.</p>

<p>In the Manual of Field Engineering, 1911, there is
a chapter devoted to Explosives, but as this work was
written before the adoption of the bomb method of
fighting it could not be expected that the subject, as
treated there, applies fully to the requirements of this
arm of the service under present-day conditions. The
Infantry being called upon to make use of explosives in
the form of bombs and grenades, makes it necessary
that they have instruction in the matter of handling,
shipping and storage of them in order to avoid accidents;
and a knowledge of their characteristics and properties
to enable them to make the best use of these
altogether necessary and useful agents.</p>

<p>The author is indebted to Capt. G. S. Laing and
Capt. G. D. Powis for valuable assistance in this work.</p>

<h3>EXPLOSIVES.</h3>


<h3>Working Knowledge.</h3>

<p><b>Handling.</b> In moving cases containing explosives
great care should be taken that they are not placed on
anything or in such a position that they might topple
over or be knocked over, or placed in such a position
that other objects might fall on them. Men who are
entrusted with the handling of these materials should
be most reliable and careful.</p>

<p><b>The Thawing of Frozen Explosives.</b> Some explosives
freeze in a temperature considerably above freezing
point, and it is necessary that they be thawed before
using. The two recognized methods of thawing frozen
explosives are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. Place in a steam heated room, but not on
the steam pipes. It is desirable that the room
have an even temperature.</p>

<p>2. By the use of a double heater; the outer
vessel to contain water at a temperature of
125 deg. F., or not hotter than can be borne by
the hand; the inner vessel contains the explosive,
care being taken that there is no fire in
the vicinity.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>A Few Causes of Accidents with Dynamite.</b> The following
are a few of the causes of accidents with explosives,
as taken from statistical information compiled
by the Ontario Bureau of Mines, and circulated for the
purpose of preventing accidents:&mdash;</p>


<h3>Dynamite.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>1. Forcing primer into hole which is too
small for it.</p>

<p>2. Presuming that the charge has a mis-fire,
and going too soon to investigate it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p>3. Tamping too tightly near the explosive
charge.</p>

<p>4. Forcing cartridge into too small a hole
or using a metal tamping rod.</p>

<p>5. Thawing dynamite before an open fire,
blacksmith&#8217;s forge, in an oven, or by the heat
of the sun&#8217;s rays through window glass.</p></blockquote>


<h3>Detonators.<br />

A Few Causes of Accidents with Detonators.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>1. Attempting to draw a wire from an electric
detonator.</p>

<p>2. Attaching a fuse to a detonator carelessly.</p>

<p>3. Trying to destroy a detonator by striking
it with a stone.</p>

<p>4. Finding a detonator and tapping it to see
if it is good.</p>

<p>5. Holding an electric detonator in a gas
flame.</p>

<p>6. By treading on a detonator a number of
them have been known to be exploded in the
same room.</p>

<p>7. By pricking the composition in a detonator
with a pin.</p>

<p>8. A spark from a miner&#8217;s lamp falling into
a box containing fuses and detonators has been
known to explode them.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Shipping.</b> When it is desired to ship explosives
from point to point by wagons or other vehicles, it is
necessary to inspect the wagons and ascertain that
everything is in order and good repair, to make sure
that the platforms of the wagons and inside of the
wagon-boxes are free from protruding nails or pieces
of metal that would tend to cause friction on the cases.
A bed of straw should be prepared and the cases placed
on their flat side, right side up, without any space left
between that would permit of displacement or cause
friction by the moving of the wagon in transportation.
Horses used for this purpose should be quiet and well
broken, and care taken that harness and accoutrements
are in a good state of repair. Roads should be chosen
as far as possible that do not lead through towns or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
thickly inhabited parts of the country. In wet weather
it is necessary that the load be covered with tarpaulin,
and in hot weather with white canvas to minimize the
effect of the sun&#8217;s rays. On reaching the destination,
wagons should be carefully unloaded and straw removed
to a safe distance and burned. In arranging for
transportation by rail or boat, the car or the boat, as
the case may be, should be thoroughly examined and
not entrusted to the dangerous load unless you are
absolutely sure it is in good order. In unloading make
sure that no vacant spaces occur between cases that
would permit of shifting or friction, and should the
entire floor of the car or boat be not occupied with
the cases the load should be fenced or blocked in
such a way as to prevent it shifting and ensure against
friction. Should any packages of explosives, when
offered for shipment, show outward signs of oily stain
or other indications that the absorption of the liquid
part of the explosive in the absorbent material is not
perfect, or that the amount of liquid part is greater
than the absorbent can carry, these packages must
under no consideration be loaded, and must be immediately
removed to a place of safety and the parties
who supplied them immediately notified thereof. The
car containing explosives must be labelled as such in
a conspicuous manner and must be hauled as near the
middle of the train as possible, and must not be placed
next to a car containing oil or inflammable material.
A flying switch must not be taken with explosives. In
case of a wreck every precaution must be taken to prevent
fire. While most of the high explosives burn
quietly when lighted in small quantities, and without
causing disastrous explosions, it must be remembered
that it is not a safe experiment.</p>

<p><b>Storage.</b> Local conditions have much to do with
the type of structure to be built for an explosives&#8217;
magazine. In general, it may be said that the lighter
the construction the better. The laws of some countries
require that all magazines be built of such
material, and in such a manner, that in the event of
an explosion the building will be completely disintegrated
and no pieces thrown to any great distance.
Storage in caves, tunnels, earth or stone-covered vaults,
and in log structures, should under no circumstances
be tolerated. The chief objection in all these cases is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
that the structure will hold dampness, and any dampness
in a magazine containing explosives into which
nitrates enter as an essential or accessory ingredient,
is certain to affect its quality and render it more or
less dangerous in subsequent use. This applies to gunpowder
and to practically all dynamites, especially
those made in America. It does not apply to Kieselguhr
Dynamite of foreign manufacture. When it is desired
to protect a magazine from rifle fire, the magazine may
be banked with earth to an extent that would be proof
against bullets, and to a height well above the cases
as arranged in the magazine; arrangements being made
for perpendicular air-shafts through the embankment
next to the outer wall at intervals necessary to give
the required ventilation; ventilating shafts being
screened with fine wire netting to exclude vermin and
constructed in such a manner that water cannot enter.
Explosives should be stored in tiers, box on box, with
laths between to prevent dampness accumulating. No
cases must be opened in the magazines, a separate
building being provided at a safe distance for that
purpose. Gunpowder and dynamites in unopened cases,
and fuses securely boxed, may be stored in the same
magazine, but no fulminates in the form of caps, or
otherwise, or loose coils of fuse, should ever be stored
in the same building with gunpowder and high explosives.
It is important that the magazine be kept
clean, and that no men with nails in their boots be
allowed to work in a magazine. No fires should be
lighted or smoking allowed in or about a magazine
containing high explosives.</p>

<h3>EXPLOSIVES.<br />

Classification, Characteristics and Properties.</h3>

<p><b>General Classification.</b> Explosives are classified
generally as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. Explosive mixtures of the nitrate class.</p>

<p>2. Explosive mixtures of the chlorate class.</p>

<p>3. Explosive compounds of the nitro-substitution
class.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
4. Explosive compounds of the nitric-derivative
class.</p>

<p>5. Explosives of the Sprengel class.</p>

<p>6. Fulminates and Amides.</p>

<p>7. Ammunition.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of the seven classifications of explosives, we are
dealing with but four in the subject of Bomb Fighting,
namely, as classified above, 1, 3, 4 and the Fulminates.</p>

<p><b>Nitrate Class.</b> Explosive mixtures of the nitrate
class. The best known example of this class is gunpowder,
the characteristics of which are that it consists
of a mechanical mixture of nitrates with some base containing
charcoal or other substance yielding carbon.
The nitrates carry the oxygen which combines with the
base, under favorable circumstances developing a large
volume of gases at a high temperature, so that if the
powder is confined at the time of explosion there will
be produced an enormous disruptive effect. The
standard composition of gunpowder is:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" summary="table">

<tr><td>Potassium Nitrate or Salt-petre &nbsp; &nbsp; </td><td class="tdr">       75 parts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Charcoal</td><td class="tdr">                                15 parts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sulphur</td><td class="tdr">                                10 parts.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>It might be interesting to note that the charcoal
employed for military and sporting powder is made
from dog-wood, while for inferior grades of powder
willow and alder are used.</p>

<p><b>Explosive Compounds of the Nitro-Substitution Class
and Nitric-Derivative Class.</b> The two explosives of these
classes which are generally known are gun-cotton and
nitro-glycerine, with special preparations made from
them, such as dynamite, blasting gelatine, etc.</p>

<p><b>Gun-Cotton.</b> Gun-cotton is made by treating suitably
prepared cotton with a mixture of one part by
weight of nitric acid and three parts sulphuric acid.
The immersion lasts 48 hours, the temperature being
maintained at 60 deg. F. The cotton is then subjected
to a thorough and prolonged washing, after which it is
carried through various processes to prepare it for use.
The cellulose of the cotton has thus been converted into
tri-nitro cellulose. By varying the strength of the
acids different degrees of nitration may be obtained.
Gun-cotton is extensively used for military purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Gun-cotton differs but slightly in appearance from
ordinary cotton. It has a harsh feel and is less flexible
than common cotton. It becomes highly electrified
when rubbed between the fingers and appears luminous
when rubbed in the dark. It is entirely insoluble in hot
or cold water, but dissolves in a mixture of ether and
ammonia. It will rarely take up more than two per
cent. of moisture from the atmosphere. It is insensible
to pressure, percussion or friction, unless closely confined
or firmly compressed. It burns with a flash,
but without explosion if brought into contact with
burning or incandescent bodies. Wet gun-cotton will
not burn or explode. Its ignition temperature is
360 degrees F. Pure gun-cotton will undergo no spontaneous
decomposition and is the safest explosive
known. Although it will not explode when wet, it may
be detonated in this condition by a Mercury Fulminate
Detonator with a small initial charge of dry gun-cotton
in contact with it.</p>

<p><b>Nitro-Glycerine.</b> Nitro-glycerine is a nitric ether,
or specifically a glyceryl tri-nitrate. Different degrees
of nitration yield the mono-di- and tri-nitro glycerine,
respectively; the latter being the nitro-glycerine of
commerce. It is made by treating an exceedingly pure
quality of glycerine with a mixture of nitric and sulphuric
acids, the proportions commonly adopted being 3
parts of nitric acid, 5 parts of sulphuric acid, and from
1 to 1.15 parts of glycerine. The glycerine is added
very slowly and with constant stirring. The agitation
of the mixture is now usually accomplished by compressed
air.</p>

<p>When made from the purest ingredients, nitro-glycerine
is an oily looking fluid, as clear and transparent
as water. When freshly made it is whitish and
opaque, but on standing it clears. The specific gravity
at normal temperature is about 1.6 deg. F., when frozen
1.735 deg. F. Nitro-glycerine dissolves in alcohol, ether,
methyl-alcohol, benzine, etc. Freshly made, opaque
nitro-glycerine freezes at from 2.2 deg. F. to 7.6 deg. F.,
while the transparent, or clear, product freezes at from
39.2 deg. F. to 37.4 deg. F. In its frozen state it is less
sensitive to shock or concussion than when it is in
liquid. It may be completely evaporated when at a
temperature of 158 deg. F. Its ignition temperature or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
firing point is 356 deg. F. Exposed to a temperature of
365 deg. F. it boils with evolution of vapors; at 381.2
deg. F. it volatilizes slowly; at 392 deg. F. it evaporates
rapidly; at 422.6 deg. F. it detonates violently.
From this point its behavior changes, passing through
temperatures at which it explodes with constantly lessening
violence until, at a dark, cherry-red heat, it
assumes a spheroidal state and fails to explode. This
applies to small quantities only. When gradually heated
it is certain to explode at 356 deg. F.</p>

<p><b>Picric Acid.</b> When coal tar is subjected to a fractional
distillation the portion which comes over up to
a temperature of 170 deg. C. is called &#8220;light oil&#8221; and
contains all the compounds of low boiling paint contained
in tar, and from this several of our most valuable
explosives can be obtained. When these light
oils have distilled over the next fraction, or &#8220;middle
oil,&#8221; yields phenol or carbolic acid, a body which
nitrated gives picric acid, which is the basis of the
French high explosive &#8220;melinite&#8221; and the English
&#8220;lyddite.&#8221;</p>

<p>Picric acid consists of a very strong nitric acid
and carbolic acid, and is a very high explosive. It
was introduced by Turpin, who mixed it with collodium
and called it &#8220;melinite,&#8221; by which name it is known
in the French Service. It forms with metals a class
of salts (picrates). The potassium salts were suggested
as a bursting charge for shells nearly fifty years
ago. Sprengel and, later, Turpin, employed the acid
itself as an explosive. It was possible to get a great
weight of explosive into small space, as the acid could
be melted and poured into the shell in a molten condition.
Picric acid is a very safe explosive, but has the
drawback of acting on metals, forming &#8220;picrates,&#8221;
some of which are more sensitive to disturbing influences
than the acid itself.</p>

<p><b>Lyddite.</b> Lyddite consists of melted solidified picric
acid, and has the same disadvantage of forming
&#8220;picrates&#8221; when in contact with metal, making it
necessary to varnish the interior of shells when used
in them. Experience with lyddite shells shows them to
be very erratic, due to the fact that they require a very
powerful detonator, the use of which is very dangerous,
as they may cause a premature explosion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p><b>T. N. T.</b> These disadvantages in picric acid led to
its being largely replaced by tri-nitro toluol, or T. N. T.,
which has a bursting pressure of 119,000 pounds per
square inch as against 135,820 pounds for picric acid.
Yet the advantages of the former more than compensate
and warrant its use being preferred. T. N. T.
does not act on metals to create sensitive salts and
is, therefore, perfectly stable. The French name for
T. N. T. is &#8220;Tolitype,&#8221; the Spanish &#8220;Trilite,&#8221; and the
German &#8220;Trotyle.&#8221; It is produced by heating troulue
with a mixture of nitric acid and sulphuric acid.</p>

<p><b>Troulue.</b> Troulue is a liquid hydro-carbon obtained
along with benzine.</p>

<p><b>Tetryl.</b> Tetryl is another coal tar product containing
more nitrogen than lyddite, and is employed in
detonators with a little lead azide, making a less sensitive
and safer preparation than fulminate of mercury.</p>

<p><b>Aunnonal.</b> Aunnonal is a mixture of T. N. T., aluminum
in fine powder and nitrate of ammonia, and a
trace of charcoal. It is safe and powerful, but has the
disadvantage of attracting moisture, and for that reason
does not always explode.</p>

<p><b>Dynamite.</b> Dynamite is the most generally used of
any blasting material in the world. It was invented in
1866 by Alfred Nobel. Its principal consisted in using
an absorbent commonly called a &#8220;dope,&#8221; which would
take up the nitro-glycerine and hold it after the manner
of a sponge.</p>

<p>A suitable dope should possess a cellular structure
so that the nitro-glycerine may be subdivided into
minute globules, each being held separately in its own
cell, completely isolated from every other. In this condition
its sensitiveness is greatly reduced, depending,
of course, on the amount of nitro-glycerine absorbed.
Dynamite may be classified, according to the nature of
the absorbent used, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">1. Dynamites with inert base,</div>
<div class="indent">(Kieselguhr, Magnesium carbonate.)</div>
<div class="verse">2. Dynamite with an active base,</div>
<div class="indent">(a) Combustible base.</div>
<div class="indent">(b) Explosive base.</div>
</div></div>

<p>The explosives&#8217; bases in (b), as above, may be of
the nitro-substitution class, or the nitric-derivative
class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>In choosing the dopes for inert bases of dynamite
where wood pulp or sawdust is employed, it should
be of some porous wood such as spruce or basswood.
Woods differ considerably in the amount of nitro-glycerine
they will absorb, ranging from 60% to 85%.
Before introducing the nitro-glycerine they should be
thoroughly dried. Good dynamite should not feel
greasy. There should be no trace of free nitro-glycerine
inside the wrapper of the cartridge. Slowly heated
dynamite explodes at a temperature of 356 deg. F. If
rapidly heated, it explodes at 446 deg. F. These temperatures
apply only to Kieselghur dynamite. The
American dynamites containing wood pulp and nitrates
will explode with somewhat lower temperatures. Like
nitro-glycerine it is most sensitive to shock and friction
just above the freezing point. According to the
dope used, it freezes at from 42 deg. F. to 46 deg. F.
It is nearly, but not quite, insensitive to shock or friction
when frozen. (See page 88, Manual of Field
Engineering.)</p>

<p><b>Fulminates.</b> These are the most powerful and dangerous
explosives in common use. They consist for the
most part of metallic salts of fulminic and amic acids.
The commonest fulminate, known as mercury fulminate,
is formed by dissolving mercury in nitric acid, to
which solution when cool is added 110 parts of alcohol.
Water is then added, causing a grey fulminate to precipitate.
This is carefully washed and air-dried. The
operation is attended with great danger. The color of
fulminate varies from a white to dirty grey. Its specific
gravity is 4.42 deg. F. It has a sweetish taste and is
highly poisonous. It is extremely sensitive to heat
and shock of every kind. Its firing point when slowly
heated is 306.5 deg. F., and when rapidly heated 368.6
deg. F. When wet it is less sensitive, but not secure
against explosion. The slightest friction will provoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
its explosion. It may be destroyed safely by treating
it with alkaline sulphides.</p>

<p>Fulminates of other metals are capable of being
made, such as fulminates of silver, gold, platinum, zinc
and copper, but these are more violently exploded and
less stable. The only one which has come into any use
being a silver compound. Mercury fulminate is the
explosive used in the manufacture of detonators. (See
page 89, Manual of Field Engineering, 1911.)</p>

<p><b>Detonators and Fuses.</b> (See pages 89, 90 and 91,
Manual of Field Engineering, 1911.)</p>

<p><b>Theory of Explosives and Fumes. Definition of
Explosive</b>: Explosive is a substance either solid, liquid,
or jelly, which, when subjected to a shock, suddenly
changes from solids, etc., to gases, at a very high temperature,
tearing to pieces any vessel which may
contain them.</p>

<p><b>Definition of an Explosion</b>: An explosion is a chemical
reaction which is completed in an exceedingly short
period of time with the evolution of a large quantity
of gas at a very high temperature. If this reaction
occurs in a body which is closely confined, the expansive
effect of the highly heated gases produces disruptive
effects. If the suddenness of the reaction is very
great, disrupted action upon solid objects in contact
with the body may be obtained even when it is unconfined,
because the cohesion of these objects can be overcome
more readily in an instant of time than the inertia
of the surrounding air. This has given rise to the
popular error that nitro-glycerine and other high explosives
act downwards; as a matter of fact they act with
equal force in all directions. It is evident, therefore,
that the violence of an explosion depends upon three
things, namely, the time occupied completing the reaction
of the explosive body; the temperature produced
by the reaction, upon which directly depends the expansive
forces of the resultant gases; and the quantity
of gas evolved by the reaction. A fourth consideration&mdash;whether
the products of the reaction are the result
of one set of chemical actions occurring simultaneously;
or whether the set of new compounds react upon each
other, producing a second set of compounds.</p>

<h3>STUDY OF A FEW OF THE PRINCIPAL<br />
TYPES OF RIFLE AND HAND<br />
GRENADES.</h3>


<p><b>General.</b> The undermentioned types of grenades,
empty, are issued for instruction:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
(a) Grenade, 303-inch, short rifle, No. 3, Mark 1. (J. pattern.)<br />
(b) Grenade, hand, No. 1, Mark 1.<br />
(c) Grenade, hand, No. 5, Mark 1.<br />
(d) Grenades, hand, Nos. 6 and 7, Mark 1.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>These grenades were also known as (a) Hales Rifle
Grenade; (b) R. L. impact or percussion grenade;
(c) Mill&#8217;s pattern grenade; (d) R. L. grenades, friction,
time.</p>

<p>Of these (a) is for firing from the point .303-inch
short rifle. Its range is about 200 yards.</p>

<p>The remainder are intended to be thrown by hand.</p>

<p>Hand grenades can be of two classes, Heavy and
Light. Heavy grenades weigh about 2 lbs. and light
about 1 lb. It is considered that a man can throw a
2-lb. weight about 30 yards and a pound-weight about
50 yards. Heavy grenades project fragments of some
weight a fair distance, while light grenades rely for
effect principally on the blast of detonation.</p>

<p>The effective area of a light grenade is mainly local,
6 yards diameter, but when possible it should not be
thrown less than 20 yards in the open, as stones, etc.,
thrown up by the explosion would be dangerous to the
thrower.</p>

<p>The danger area of the heavy grenade is about 30
yards in diameter, and, therefore, it should not be
thrown less than 25 yards in the open. With both
grenades the thrower should cover the eyes at the
moment of explosion and protect himself, as small frag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>ments
of metal may carry further than the distance
mentioned.</p>

<p>The types of hand grenades (b), (c) and (d) differ
fundamentally in the means by which ignition is
effected; (b) explodes instantaneously on impact (by
percussion), while (c) and (d) are fired by time fuse,
which is lit in (c) by spring action releasing a trigger
at the moment the grenade leaves the thrower&#8217;s hand,
and in (d) by an independent action on the part of the
thrower before throwing the grenade.</p>

<p>In the case of (b) it is necessary that the grenade
fall head first. This is done by the backward pull in
the air of the streamers attached to the handle. In
using this grenade it is, therefore, necessary to see that
the streamers are opened out and free&mdash;before throwing,
and to throw the grenade well upwards.</p>

<p>In the case of (d) the total time of delay is slightly
over 5 seconds, so that from 1&frac12; to 2 seconds should
be used in throwing. If thrown hastily it may arrive
at the mark 3 seconds before exploding and allow it to
be returned by the enemy.</p>

<p>When handling detonators for grenades, it should
be remembered that the detonator by itself is capable
of blowing the hand off, so it must be carefully handled,
and if an igniter is accidentally fired it should be
thrown a few yards clear of any one in the neighborhood.
When the igniters and detonators are in the
grenades reasonable care should be taken to avoid rough
usage as violent treatment might fire the grenades, even
in the safe position.</p>

<p><b>Grenade .303-inch, Short Rifle, No. 3, Mark 1 (J.
pattern). Description</b>: The grenade consists of a steel
body filled with explosive. Down the centre of the
explosive is a brass tube into the forward end of which
the detonator is inserted. The rearward end of the
body is closed by the base piece which carries the needle
pellet, two retaining bolts, wind vane and releasing
socket with safety pin. To the base piece is fixed a
base plug carrying the spring clip and a 10-inch steel
rod.</p>

<p>The action of the grenade is that, the safety pin
having been removed, on firing the releasing socket
sets back from under the wind vane, which is then
revolved by the wind pressure as the grenade travels
through the air. After a few turns of the vane the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
retaining bolts are no longer held in position by its
inner surface.</p>

<p>On impact the needle pellet sets forward against
the creep spring, on the detonator cap, firing the
grenade.</p>

<p>The steel body is serrated so as to furnish numerous
missiles.</p>

<p><b>Package of Grenades</b>: The wooden box provided
carries 20 grenades in protecting tins with screw-off
lids, 20 detonators, rifle grenades in four tin boxes
with lever lids, and 22 special blank cartridges in a
tin box.</p>

<p><b>Preparation for Firing</b>: The grenade is removed
from its tin and the ebonite plug in its head is unscrewed
by hand. The grenade is held nose down to
make sure that the needle pellet is held by the retaining
bolts.</p>

<p>If correct, the detonator is inserted and screwed
home.</p>

<p>The rod is then gently lowered into the rifle, the
clip sprung on the muzzle and a blank cartridge inserted
in the chamber.</p>

<p>The safety pin is withdrawn just before firing.</p>

<p>If, after the safety pin has been removed, the
grenade is not used, the safety pin may be replaced
if the screwed ring has not unscrewed and uncovered
the two retaining bolts, but if these are uncovered
the grenade is in a dangerously sensitive condition, and
if so found should be destroyed. Only the special detonators
and cartridges provided should be used.</p>

<p>If by accident a grenade were fired with a bulleted
round the rifle would probably burst and injure
firer.</p>

<p>This grenade is very safe to handle, as it cannot
be fired by knocking or dropping on the ground; it
must travel through the air some distance before the
retaining bolts fall out.</p>

<p><b>Pendulum Dial Sights.</b> A pendulum dial sight
graduated in yards, for direct aim or high elevation,
is issued for use with the rifle grenades, and can be
easily affixed to the leaf of the back-sight.</p>

<p>Should the sight not fit tightly on the leaf, the
spring sides should be slightly pinched in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Grenade, Hand, No. 1, Mark 1. Description</b>: The
grenade consists of a brass cylinder encircled by a
narrow cast-iron ring serrated to break up into 16
fragments.</p>

<p>The cylinder is mounted on a wood block to which
a cane handle, with streamer, is attached.</p>

<p>The brass cylinder or body of the grenade is filled
with explosive, and has its upper end closed by the
detonator holder, fixed by three screws. This holder
carries two pins for securing the detonator. The body
has fitted above the serrated ring two knobs and two
indicating stops.</p>

<p>The firing needle is carried in the removable cap,
which has two grooves formed on it in which slide
the knobs on the body. The cap is centrally pierced
for the safety pin.</p>

<p>On the outer surface of the cap are stamped the
words &#8220;Remove,&#8221; &#8220;Travel&#8221; and &#8220;Fire.&#8221; When the
knobs are in the groove &#8220;Remove,&#8221; as indicated by
the stops, the cap can be removed and replaced; the
central position, marked &#8220;Travel,&#8221; is to be adhered
to normally; while in the position &#8220;Fire&#8221; the cap,
after removal of the safety pin, is held in position
by friction only, and can be pressed inwards to fire
the grenade.</p>

<p>The action of the grenade is simply that the cap
is forced in on impact, carrying the needle on to the
detonator, the cap having been turned into the position
&#8220;Fire&#8221; and the safety pin having been removed
before the throwing.</p>

<p><b>Packing</b>: The grenades are packed six in a wooden
box. Cylinders containing 10 detonators, No. 1 Hand
Grenade, Marks I. or II., are issued separately.</p>

<p><b>Preparation</b>: The cap is removed, a detonator
is inserted in the recess, the grooves in the detonator
being placed opposite the pins on the body, and the
detonator is then pressed home and turned to the left
(its flange being under the heads of the two pins)
until the spring on the detonator flange is released thus
locking it in position.</p>

<p>The cap is then replaced and turned into the position
&#8220;Travel.&#8221;</p>

<p>The safety pin must on no account be withdrawn
during these operations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>The cap from one grenade will not invariably fit
another grenade well, and steps should be taken to
prevent caps and grenades being interchanged.</p>

<p><b>Throwing the Grenade</b>: When it is required to
use the grenades, all on the belt should be turned to
&#8220;Fire,&#8221; and the whipcord beckets and leather strips
should be removed from the safety pins.</p>

<p>When a grenade is taken from the belt, the
streamer is unwound and allowed to hang free, and
the safety pin is withdrawn immediately before throwing.</p>

<p>The grenade is grasped by the end of the handle
and thrown in the required direction, care being taken
that the streamer does not get entangled with the
thrower.</p>

<p>To insure the grenade firing on impact, it should
be thrown well upwards, at an angle of not less than
35 degrees.</p>

<p>Should the grenade not be used the cap should
be turned back to &#8220;Travel&#8221; and the safety pin replaced
and secured by passing the whipcord becket
over the cap and threading the leather strip through
the slot in the end of the safety pin.</p>

<p><b>Grenade, Hand, No. 5, Mark 1. Description</b>: The
body of the grenade is of cast-iron, serrated to provide
numerous missiles on detonation. Into one end
is screwed a centre piece, with separate recesses for
the striker and detonator.</p>

<p>The striker is kept cocked against its spring by
its head catching on the end of the striker lever when
the latter lies against the body of the grenade, pivoted
on its fulcrum pin.</p>

<p>The lever is retained in its position by the safety
pin.</p>

<p>The detonator is a separate unit, consisting of
cap, cap chamber, safety fuse, and detonator.</p>

<p>The action of the grenade is that, after the safety
pin is withdrawn, on throwing the grenade the lever
swings outward under the pull of the striker pin
spring, thus releasing the striker, which fires the cap.
The safety fuse burns less than five seconds and then
fires the detonator.</p>

<p><b>Packing</b>: The grenades are packed 12 in a wooden
box, together with a cylinder containing 12 detonators
and lengths of safety fuse attached.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Preparation and Use of the Grenade</b>: Unscrew the
base plug, insert the detonator, etc., into the recesses
provided and replace the plug.</p>

<p>The grenade is then held in the throwing hand
in such a manner that the striker lever is held securely
against the body of the grenade by some part of the
hand.</p>

<p>The safety pin is pulled out by the other hand
just before the grenade is thrown.</p>

<p>If not thrown the safety pin should be replaced.</p>

<p><b>Grenades, Hand, Nos. 6 and 7, Mark 1. Description</b>:
The grenades consist of tin vessels filled with high explosives
and are packed 40 in each packing case, with
four haversacks.</p>

<p>The &#8220;HEAVY GRENADE,&#8221; weight about 1 lb. 13
oz., contains an outer layer of scrap iron. The igniter
socket is closed by a wooden plug for transit, and
covered by a papier mache cap.</p>

<p>The &#8220;LIGHT GRENADE&#8221; is entirely filled with
explosive. Weight slightly over 1 lb.</p>

<p>The IGNITERS and DETONATORS, packed 10 in
a tin and 40 in each packing case, consist of a
friction igniter, a length of safety-fuse and a service
detonator. The friction igniter consists of the holder
to which is fixed a flange with two notches and two
springs. It also has two horns, which form a grip
for turning the igniter into the locked position. The
friction bar is fixed to a button through which the
firing loop passes.</p>

<p>The HAVERSACK is intended to be carried
similarly to be ordinary service haversack, but the
sling is shorter to cause the grenades to rest above
the hip and as far as possible clear of other equipment.</p>

<p>The loose strings should be tied round the waist
to prevent the pockets sagging and the grenades
knocking against one another.</p>

<p><b>Preparation of Grenade</b>: Remove papier mache
cap and the wooden plug from the igniter socket.
Tear the strip from the tin box containing the ten
igniters, insert an igniter in the socket so that the
notches in the flange pass over the brass studs on
the grenade. Turn the igniter in either direction
until it is locked by the springs on the flange and one
of the studs which is then held between the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
springs. If it is required to remove an igniter, one
of the springs must be kept pressed down while the
igniter is turned till the spring is clear of the stud.
Replace the papier mache cap and place the grenade
in a pocket of the haversack with the cap uppermost.</p>

<p><b>Firing the Grenade</b>: Remove the papier mache cap.</p>

<p>Hold the grenade in the right (or throwing) hand
so that the igniter is towards the wrist, the forefinger
over the bottom of the grenade. Pass the forefinger
of the other hand through the firing loop and,
when ready to throw, pull with a sharp jerk. If a
second&#8217;s time is taken and the grenade bowled or thrown
it should explode soon after reaching the mark.</p>

<h3>BOMBERS&#8217; TRAINING&mdash;PART I.</h3>


<p><b>Discipline.</b> Soldiers do not receive any training
in bombing until they have passed the recruit stage,
in which special attention is given that a very high
degree of discipline is attained. In bomb fighting
and trench warfare a higher degree of discipline is demanded.
In addition to the discipline which enables
a unit to go on parade and carry out the different
movements as one man, it is necessary that every
man be taught in such a way that, should circumstances
arise, that he should be cut off from his comrades
he can carry on intelligently as a little unit by
himself, doing the right thing at the right time. It
is only by training that enables him to do this in the
absence of commanders that the necessary degree of
efficiency can be attained.</p>

<p><b>Organization.</b> The use of bombs was adopted by
the British War Office early in the summer of 1915.
The organization put into effect in England was as
follows: In each brigade was formed what was
known as the Brigade Bombers&#8217; Company. Men were
detailed from each of the units forming the brigade
for their initial training, which lasted over a period
of six days. During the first of the training periods
at least one subaltern per battalion should be attached
to the Brigade Company for training, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
that the battalion is provided with an officer qualified
to superintend the training of the battalion
bombers&#8217; section. This officer and others should return
to the brigade company for short periods of
training from time to time as it has been found that
new technical as well as tactical ideas are continually
being introduced into this important branch of work.</p>

<p>One sergeant, two corporals and 32 rank and file
are detailed from each battalion. The company is
commanded by a selected officer, who will be assisted
by an additional N.C.O., who acts in the capacity of
C.S.M. and C.Q.M.S. The Company is kept up to
strength by a system of relays, so that at the end of
each three days half the men of the Company are
returned to their units for duty, their place being
taken by others detailed for that purpose. It will be
seen that by this method in a short time the entire
brigade will have received their preliminary training
in this subject. It must not be considered that their
training in bombing is complete at the end of six
days, further periods for practices being arranged
for in their weekly training syllabus. The preliminary
training having been completed, there is formed
what was known as a permanent Brigade Bombers&#8217;
Company.</p>

<p><b>The Battalion Bombers&#8217; Section.</b> The Battalion
Bombers&#8217; Section, when complete, should consist of
about 40 trained men, including N.C.O.&#8217;s, but the
training of all men should be proceeded with so that
ultimately every man in the battalion is qualified.
When trained a thrower should be able, when standing
in a trench behind one traverse, to place 75 per
cent. of his bombs in a bay on the farther side of a
traverse 30 yards away. To be an expert bomber,
one must be fit. It is therefore necessary to take a
certain amount of physical exercise each day while
in training and when on active service. In this
respect the grenadiers are especially cared for. They
are given special privileges, given the best of billets
and shorter hours in the trenches, which gives them
plenty of time for exercise, and their favorite games,
which keeps them in good condition. Drinking is
not prohibited, but if a man expects to be able to
keep cool and think and act quickly it is better to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
temperate. A bombers&#8217; duties in the trenches are
looked upon as most interesting and lack monotony.
If he understands his work and the grenades, that is,
when they are safe, he has nothing to fear, although
he will find that some of his more ignorant pals may
shun him when he goes about with his full complement,
in fact, they will make way wherever he goes.
When our First Canadian Division went into the
trenches, as also have many other reinforcing battalions,
without a sufficient knowledge of bombs, the
result was that many accidents occurred through
carelessness and ignorance and lack of training in this
important branch of work.</p>

<p><b>Practice in Making and Throwing of Dummy Bombs.</b>
In order that the men may become proficient in the
matter of throwing live bombs it is necessary to have
dummies which represent as nearly as possible in size,
shape and weight the live manufactured types which
are used in active service. The men are accordingly
taught to make these by hand. There are four types
of these, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(a) <b>The Jam-Tin Dummy</b>, which is made
with an empty jam tin, three-quarters filled
with clay, the top being drawn together and
sewn with wire. This type contains no explosives.</p>

<p>(b) A jam-tin made in the same manner
but in the centre of the tin is placed half a
cartridge of monobel with fuse and cap.
These two types of bombs are made to weigh
from one to two and a quarter pounds, and
may be thrown from thirty to fifty yards.</p>

<p>(c) <b>Powder Puffs</b>: A powder puff is representative
of a hair brush bomb and consists
of a piece of wood 1&#8221; x 5&#8221; x 17&#8221;, 7&#8221; at
one end being left full size, the remainder
being cut away on each edge to form a
handle. On the broad part of this is placed
another piece of wood 2&#8221; x 4&#8221; x 6&#8221; with a hole
1&#8540;&#8221; in diameter bored through the centre.
This piece of 2&#8221; x 4&#8221; is attached by wire nails
to the 1&#8221; x 5&#8221;; the centre space is filled with
gunpowder and covered with a small piece
of 1-inch board, the fuse being inserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
through a &#8540;-inch hole, which is bored
through the 1&#8221; x 5&#8221;. The explosive used in
the hair brush, which this dummy represents
is a slab of wet gun-cotton, 1&frac34;&#8221; x 3&#8221; x 6&#8221;
with a 1&#8540;&#8221; cone-shaped hole in the centre
to receive a dry gun-cotton primer which
has a &#8540;&#8221; hole in its centre to receive the
detonator, which in turn receives the fuse.
The weight of slab 15 ounces; the weight of
primer 1 ounce.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Hand Grenade, No. 1, Mark 1, Dummy.</b></p>

<p>(d) A piece of 2&#8221; x 2&#8221; wood, 17&#8221; long, one
end shaped for a handle, the other end made
partially round, a 1&frac34;&#8221; gas pipe union being
put over the handle end and driven tightly
on to the large end of the stick. A groove is
cut around the stick about 8&#8221; from the handle
end, to which is wired three pieces of cotton
about 1&frac12;&#8221; x 24&#8221; long. These act as streamers
and tend to keep the business end of the
bomb forward in its flight.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Note</b>: The idea of the explosive being used in
the dummy bombs is to accustom the men to handling
explosives, the lighting of fuses and gauging of
the time required per inch for a service fuse to burn,
at the same time not sacrificing distance and accuracy
in throwing. It has been noticed that men in
their eagerness to get rid of the live bomb lose sight
of the main object for which they are being trained,
namely, accuracy and range.</p>

<p><b>Throwing Position.</b> The correct position for
throwing is as follows:&mdash;Spread the feet slightly and
brace them firmly on the ground, the shoulder opposite
the throwing hand being in the direction to
which you are throwing. Bring the other hand containing
the bomb upwards with a straight arm and
circular motion, releasing the bomb when the hand
is above the head. It is impossible in a narrow trench
to move from a standing position when throwing.
The men in throwing practices should therefore be
made to maintain a standing position.</p>

<p><b>Sandbags.</b> It is necessary that all men engaged
in trench fighting should be specially taught in the
uses of sandbags and the methods of filling, tying and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
passing them in the trench. The method of passing
sandbags in a trench is as follows: The men place
themselves from two to three paces apart with their
backs in the direction to which they are passing the
sandbags and pass them between their legs from one
to another. This method has the double advantage
of enabling them to pass them very quickly and keep
their heads down out of danger from rifle and M. G.
fire at the same time. The men should receive further
practice in the manner of building them up to
form blockades and breast works, etc., in order that
they may acquire speed in this matter. In the absence
of a full supply of sandbags, grain sacks or
flour sacks may be used.</p>

<p><b>Training in the Use of Digging and Cutting Tools.</b>
Frequent practices should be carried out in order that
the men are efficiently trained in this work. It is very
necessary that the men should be taught the use of
these tools in the different positions, that is, standing,
kneeling and lying. This can only be accomplished by
frequent practices.</p>

<p><b>Training in Reconstruction and Repair Work.</b> This
can be carried out with success in the dummy
trenches which we use for practices in bomb throwing
and by changing the front of these trenches and
wrecking them it is possible for the men to get practice
in the use of the different materials employed
in reconstruction and repair work, such as earth,
sandbags, sods, timber, brushwood, bale wire and material
obtained from old packing cases.</p>

<p><b>Means of Egress from Trench.</b> On taking up a
position in a trench men should be taught to provide
means of egress therefrom at their first opportunity.
This is done by cutting steps in the walls of the
trench, just sufficiently large enough to enable them
to get a foot-hold; the bottom part of this being reinforced
with a small piece of board to keep the earth
from breaking away. A hand hold is provided at
the top by means of a stake driven into the ground
or a small piece of wood secured by bale wire to a
&#8220;dead man&#8221; buried in the parapet. By these means
the whole line is enabled to go forward at the same
time should occasion demand it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Passing of Orders and Information in the Trenches.</b>
Men should be taught the art of passing of orders and
information correctly, by word of mouth. This is a
very important part of the soldiers&#8217; training, and
should always be practised when the trench practices
are being carried out; a sender of messages being
placed at one end of the line and a receiver at the other
to keep a record of messages, etc.</p>

<p><b>Trench Comforts.</b> A little study in the matter of
personal comforts in the trenches will prove to be of
great advantage to the men. The clothing should be
tight fitting about the neck and waist to prevent falling
earth and pebbles getting inside the clothing and
working down into the boots. The men should be
instructed to take a change of socks when they go
in the trenches and it is also necessary not to forget
to have a supply of smokes; in short, by paying attention
to these small matters there may be many
comforts enjoyed in the trenches which would otherwise
be overlooked.</p>

<p><b>Uses of Bombs.</b>&mdash;The uses of bombs may be classified
under two heads, <b>Defensive and Offensive</b>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Defensive</b>:</p>

<p>(a) Throwing from sapheads to prevent the
enemy from pushing their saps too close to our
trenches or strong places.</p>

<p>(b) To combat the enemy&#8217;s enfilade attack
in our trench should they be successful
in gaining entrance thereto.</p>

<p>(c) From concealed positions bombs may
be used to break up and throw into confusion
an enemy&#8217;s attacking force; this especially applies
to night attacks when enemy is advancing
in close formation.</p>

<p><b>Offensive</b>:</p>

<p>(a) By throwing from sapheads when destroying
the enemy&#8217;s keeps and strong
places.</p>

<p>(b) Supplying cover fire for wire cutters,
sappers, etc.</p>

<p>(c) Assisting in a frontal attack on an
enemy&#8217;s position.</p>

<p>(d) Following up advantages gained in
a frontal attack by an enfilade attack to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
flanks and our front from position gained in
enemy&#8217;s trenches.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Advantages of Bomb and Grenade Fire Over Rifle
Fire.</b> It must not be supposed that when advantages
are claimed for bomb and grenade fire over rifle fire
that the latter has not its advantages, too. The advantages
of bomb and grenade fire must be at short
range and are, therefore, specially adapted to the type
of warfare waged at present on the Western front
and may be considered as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(a) Owing to the high and pronounced
trajectory we are able by the use of bombs to
reach the enemy in his trench, whereas with
rifle fire the only precaution necessary on the
part of the enemy is to keep his head below
the parapet, the trajectory of rifle fire being
practically flat at point blank range.</p>

<p>(b) It is possible with a single 2-pound
bomb to obtain an effective zone of 20 yards
and a danger space of 40 yards in the enemy&#8217;s
trench which is dead ground to rifle fire.</p>

<p>(c) The moral effect of bomb fire is much
greater than that of rifle fire.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Means of Protection Against Enemy&#8217;s Bombs.</b></p>

<p>(a) <b>The Use of Wire Netting</b>: Trenches,
machine gun pits, etc., are covered with
close wire netting to prevent the entrance of
enemy&#8217;s bombs. Low screens of wire netting
may be placed in front of the parapet to prevent
rolling bombs getting into our trenches.</p>

<p>(b) The <b>Digging</b> of small <b>Ditches</b> and the
<b>Breaking</b> up of the <b>Surface</b> of the <b>Ground</b> in
front of our position is an effective way of
preventing bombs from rolling towards our
position.</p>

<p>(c) The adoption of shallow <b>Sleeping
Pits</b> in the rear of our trenches to provide
quarters for the reliefs has been proven a success.</p>

<p>(d) Trenches should not be made wider or
deeper than is absolutely necessary, as the
effect of high explosives in deep trenches is
much more deadly than in shallow ones, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the highest part of the parapet and parados
should be next to the trench and sloping
slightly from the trench, the idea being not
to aid bombs in rolling into the trench.</p>

<p>(e) Bomb and splinter proof shelters may
be built over keeps, trenches and other strong
places.</p>

<p>(f) The use of sapheads from which
bomb fire is provided to keep the enemy from
getting into bombing range of our positions.
(See Fig. 1.)</p>

<p>(g) <b>Obstacles</b> should be placed in front of
our trenches at sufficient distance when possible
to prevent enemy throwing bombs into
the latter from behind these obstacles. This
will disallow of bombing covering fire for
their wire cutters.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Storage of Bombs in Trenches.</b> Each platoon
commander in the trenches is responsible that he has
a supply of bombs and grenades and procures the
same from the brigade bombers&#8217; magazine, which is
located anywhere from 1,500 to 2,500 yards in the rear
of the front line trenches. They are stored in the
trenches in bomb and splinter proof pits provided for
that purpose.</p>

<p><b>General Efficiency and Resourcefulness.</b> When a
unit goes into the trenches the success with which it
meets depends entirely on the degree of efficiency and
resourcefulness and physical condition of the men. We
are taught in the different Training Manuals that the
British forces do not retreat and should it be necessary
that from a tactical or strategical standpoint
the commanders of our forces consider it necessary
to give ground, the movement is carried out under
what is known as a rear guard action and must not
under any circumstances be considered in the nature
of a defeat, the reason for this being that with anything
like equality in numbers, equipment and armament,
we are more than a match for the fighting
forces of any other nation. Assuming this to be true,
it is not so much the training in the building of our
trenches that our men require as the training that
will enable them on occupying the enemy&#8217;s trenches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
to reconstruct and repair them to meet our own requirements.
This work has often to be carried out
in daylight and under fire, making it necessary for the
men to work in a prone position. It is therefore
necessary that the men be skilled in the use of the
digging and cutting tools used in trench warfare in
order that accordingly as we occupy the enemy&#8217;s
trenches they may be consolidated for our use and
kept in repair as long as they are required for fighting,
communication or storage trenches. By this
means the ground we gain is consolidated for our
purposes as we advance. On the other hand, if we
do not consolidate our position as we advance we are
left more or less in a state of unpreparedness and
give the enemy a chance to launch a counter-attack
with good results. All the training that our men can
possibly receive on the subjects of musketry, bomb
throwing, etc., that fits them for trench warfare is
practically lost unless they are thoroughly skilled in
the use of the trench digging and cutting tools, in
which they require as much training as in the use of
the rifle. This can only be accomplished by a systematic
arrangement and carrying out of practices in
trenches which are built for that purpose. To accomplish
the desired results special attention should be
given to the instruction and training that will enable
a soldier to use intelligently the different kinds of
material which may come to hand. For example, our
men may be taught to repair a trench by the use of
sandbags, sods and brushwood, but might not be able
to obtain these materials. At the same time back of
the lines there might be all kinds of bale wire, packing
cases, cull lumber, etc., by means of which, with
a little instruction, the same work of repairing the
trench might be accomplished. It is only by getting
down into the ground and working out these problems
for ourselves and making note of the little things, not
being above taking suggestions from the last private
in the ranks, that we will be efficient to a degree necessary
to outwit and defeat our ever industrious and
systematic enemy.</p>

<h3>FRONTAL ATTACK.</h3>


<p><b>Preparation and Organization.</b> In trench warfare,
when our movements are changed from the defensive
to the offensive, it is necessary to choose certain sections
of the enemy&#8217;s front line of trenches. These are
chosen from a tactical point of view, and after having
been occupied and consolidated to our use become the
bases from which enfilade attacks are directed to the
flanks and front, by means of which we extend and connect
our positions. The Officers and their Staffs ordering
the offensive, make a very careful study of the
neighborhood in the sections to be occupied from maps
and sketches which have been compiled from information
gained by the Air Service and Reconnaisance. They
finally decide the exact extent of front which will be
occupied in each case by direct frontal attack. The
extent of front in each case is never greater than is
absolutely necessary, and is clearly defined in orders.
Every officer taking a part in the assault is supplied
with maps and sketches, which constitute part of his
orders.</p>

<p>(Note the necessity for every officer being able to
make a study of a locality from information given on
maps and sketches.)</p>

<p>Arrangements are made for the co-operation of the
different arms of the service taking part in the assault,
such as the engineers, artillery, air service and infantry.
A schedule or program is arranged covering
the movements of the different arms of the service,
which are carried out by time-table, each Officer and
Non-Commissioned Officer having correct divisional
time.</p>

<p>Arrangements are made for reinforcements, ammunition,
supplies and materials necessary to carry out the
attack and consolidate the new positions to be taken,
also for the establishment and maintenance of com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>munication.
Artillery fire is directed on the positions
to be occupied, also on the trenches to each flank and
the rear of the same, and on the enemy&#8217;s obstacles for
a period of from thirty minutes to several hours prior
to the advancing of the infantry.</p>

<p>Saps are run out in front of our obstacles and as
much progress as possible is made in joining up the
sapheads to form a new line of trenches from which
to deliver the actual assault without the hindrance of
our own obstacles.</p>

<p>Our troops are massed as near as possible to the
front line in readiness for the assault. The supplies
of ammunition and material are brought forward to as
convenient a position as possible, to be taken into the
new position at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>Saps are extended towards the enemy&#8217;s machine gun
positions and any positions from which they could supply
cover fire, and bombs are thrown from these to
finish the work of the artillery in the destruction of
the same.</p>

<p>At the time arranged in the program the artillery
cease fire on the enemy&#8217;s obstacles and our wire cutters
advance, covered by bomb fire, to finish the work
of the artillery in the destruction of the obstacles.
The wire-cutters are armed with axes, saws, billhooks,
crowbars, wire-cutters, and high explosive
bombs, and when they have cleared the way sufficiently
for our men to pass, the signal is given and the first
line of bayonet men goes forward accompanied by a
few bombers. They are joined in the attack by the
wire-cutters.</p>

<p>The first line is followed by a second line and possibly
a third, before the section of the enemy&#8217;s trench
is occupied.</p>

<p><b>The Assault.</b> The assault may be said to be classified
under three heads, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
1. SUPPRESSION OF THE ENEMY&#8217; FIRE.<br />
2. DESTRUCTION OF THE ENEMY&#8217;S OBSTACLES.<br />
3. THE ACTUAL DELIVERY OF THE ASSAULT.

<h2 class="nobreak">LECTURE VI.</h2></div>

<h3>CONSOLIDATING THE GROUND GAINED.</h3>


<p><b>Consolidating the Ground Gained.</b> Immediately we
have occupied the new positions, it is necessary to
reorganize our forces (the flanks being protected by
bombing parties while this work is being carried out).
The different parties and reliefs necessary are formed,
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
(A) SENTRIES AND RELIEFS.<br />
(B) RECONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR PARTIES.<br />
(C) SAPPERS AND DIGGERS.<br />
(D) SUPPLY PARTY.<br />
(E) COMMUNICATION MEN.
</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Sentries and Reliefs.</b> (A) In each bay of the trench
it is necessary at all times to have one man on sentry
and, as a rule, three men in relief, and it is very important
that means be provided that the reliefs get
the necessary rest and sleep. Accordingly, shallow
sleeping-out pits are provided in the rear of the trenches
for that purpose. This work is accomplished by the
sappers and the diggers with the assistance of the
reliefs.</p>

<p><b>Reconstruction and Repair.</b> (B) It is very important
that the reconstruction and repair work be got under
way as quickly as possible after occupying the new
position, as any lack of time affords the enemy an
excellent chance to launch a counter-attack. Accordingly,
the entire party are put to work until this object
is accomplished. Communication trenches and other
trenches along which we do not intend to extend our
frontage at the present time will be double-blocked by
the use of sandbags, sentries being placed to guard
same. What was the enemy&#8217;s communication trench
prior to our occupation now really becomes our sapheads,
so it is necessary to construct positions in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
from which we can throw bombs to keep the enemy in
the next line of trenches at his distance until such
time as we are prepared to extend our position in that
direction. The work of reversing the fire trench (what
was the enemy&#8217;s parados now becomes our parapet)
must be completed as soon as possible, and means of
egress from the trenches must be supplied in order that
every man can advance at the same instant should
occasion arise.</p>

<p>(C) At the earliest opportunity it will be necessary
to connect up our new position with our old by a continuation
of what were formerly our sapheads, to enable
us to get in our supply of reinforcements, materials,
food, water and ammunition.</p>

<p>(D) It will be the duty of men reinforcing to bring
forward a supply of ammunition, bombs and materials
for reconstruction and consolidation of the new position
and a supply of food and water.</p>

<p>(E) Arrangements will have been previously made
for a line of communication men to establish telephone
and telegraph communication and to maintain same.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">LECTURE VII.</h2></div>

<h3>ENFILADE ATTACK.</h3>


<p><b>Enfilading Parties and Reliefs.</b> Having occupied the
section of trenches as pre-arranged, and consolidated
same under cover of bomb fire, we use this as a base
from which to extend our position to the flanks and
front along the enemy&#8217;s trenches, by means of enfilading
parties.</p>

<p>An enfilading party may consist of three or more
men. When it consists of three men, they are the
BAYONET MAN, the THROWER, and the CARRIER.
The bayonet man is really a trench scout, who proceeds
ahead and is armed with a RIFLE and BAYONET,
or, better still, a PAIR OF PISTOLS. His duties are
to spy out the trench and pass back information to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
thrower as to the locality and direction of the bays in
front. In giving information to the thrower as to the
location of different points which he wants bombed, the
clock method may be used; the thrower&#8217;s position being
the centre of an imaginary dial and twelve o&#8217;clock
directly in front and in line with the section of the
trench from which the thrower is throwing. It can be
easily seen that by this method information can be
given the thrower as to the bends and twists of the
trench. Another method the trench scout may use
is merely pointing the direction in which he wants the
bomb placed, and denoting the number of yards distant.
The trench scout should be very careful in watching
out for loopholes through traverses from which the
enemy could guard against the approach of an enfilading
party, also give information when an island traverse
or communicating trench is reached. In the former
case it will be necessary for an additional scout, one to
proceed each way. In the latter case, sandbags will
probably be required to double-block the communicating
trench and information passed back to this effect so
that supply men can rush them forward for that purpose.</p>

<p>It is necessary that the trench scout be a very wide-awake,
careful and resourceful man, and have his wits
about him at all times.</p>

<p>In the absence of an officer or N.C.O. in the enfilading
party the thrower commands and is responsible that
signals be given that the artillery know the exact extent
of our frontage at all times. This is done by means
of a flag which is khaki colored on the enemy&#8217;s side and
red on our own side, so that it can be easily picked up
by our artillery, the flag being maintained in a correct
position by the use of a double flag-staff. At night the
signal may be given by the use of flashes or any other
pre-arranged signals.</p>

<p>The carrier&#8217;s duty is to follow up and keep supplied
with a stock of bombs, and to pass back information,
messages and orders.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
